\title{Plot heavy-tailed deviations}
\usage{
plot_tails(vec, log = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{vec}{Vector of random deviates.}

\item{log}{Should the y-axis be log transformed?}
}
\value{
A scatter plot showing the deviation values in the vector. Sample
  mean is shown by dashed blue line, and the marginal distribution is shown
  by the rug plot on the right side of the plot.
}
\description{
A simple graphical representation of random heavy-tailed deviations created
with `rpareto_tails()`, `rst_tails()`, `rnorm_tails()`, or any other
multiplicative random deviates.
}
\details{
If `vec` is the output of `rnorm_tails()` where sporadic values have
  been included, these values are marked in red.
}
\examples{
rpt <- rpareto_tails(50, 3)
plot_tails(rpt)

}
